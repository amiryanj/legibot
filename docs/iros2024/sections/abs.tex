With the prevalence of social robots in various environments and applications, there is an increasing need for these robots to exhibit socially-compliant behaviors.
Legible motion, characterized by the ability of a robot to clearly and quickly convey intentions and goals to the individuals in its vicinity, holds significant importance in this context.
%
%In this paper, we introduce a pioneering framework for assessing the legibility of robot motion.
%Our approach leverages optical flow-based visual input to simulate how a human observer perceives a robot's actions.
%
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to incorporate legibility into local motion planning for mobile robots.
This can enable robots to generate legible motions in real-time and dynamic environments.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology,
we conducted real-world experiments involving the Pepper robot and simulated scenarios featuring mobile robots in a restaurant environment with multiple human occupants.
